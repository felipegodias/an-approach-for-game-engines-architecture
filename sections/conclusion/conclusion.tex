\section{Conclusion}
Despite the efforts to create a new game engine from scratch its still have several performance issues, and even Unity supporting a lot of awesome features it still beats Pluto from both FPS and load times, but we can notice that Pluto is not using the same Memory, CPU and GPU usage as Unity, so there's a lot of room for improvements in there but that would take more time to implement it. As well for the size of the application, we can see that Unity has a lot of footprint for a basic game such as Flappy Bird and if you think in community support Pluto totally lack of it and Unity has one of the largest communities in the game engine industry, in the other hand, game developers need to keep up with Unity feature schedule that can delay the implementation of new features and bug corrections. So if you just want to create games, the benchmarks shown in this article suggests that using an engine already established in the market will increase the chances for better result because that will be much less time consuming and the development team can focus only in the game logic itself then creating a new engine from scratch, unless the goal is to study how game engines work or it is a big company that wants to take control of every little bit in their games.
