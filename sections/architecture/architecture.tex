\section{Game Engine Architecture}\label{sec:game-egnine-architecture}
In the sections bellow the main features from a game engine will be described in a architectural level and how software engineers can start a new game engine. The steps described will consider a bottom-up architecture but many times a game engine evolves through time in a way that we can't always predict new features for it, and it can make the source code become a spaghetti but with a good architecture this can be minimized\cite{TheCaseForResearchInGameEngineArchitecture, GameEngineArchitecture}.
