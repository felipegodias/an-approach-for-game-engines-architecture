\subsubsection{Services}
In this approach, services or subsystems are the most top abstraction level for the game engine features. Since a game engine has too many features a service pattern can help the start-up and shut-down process of the features. Each service can be represented as a singleton\footnote{"Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it."\cite{GangOfFour}} and a service collection or a service locator\footnote{"Provide a global point of access to a service without coupling users to the concrete class that implements it."\cite{GameProgrammingPatterns}} can be implemented to help subsystems find each dependencies that is needed for them, sometimes a dependency injector\footnote{"Dependency Injection is a set of software design principles and patterns that enable us to develop loosely coupled code"\cite{DependencyInjectionIn.NET}} can be implemented for each service to help identify these dependencies. Services in this context are the memory manager, event manager, file system, resource manager and others\cite{GameEngineArchitecture,3DGameEngineArchitecture}.
