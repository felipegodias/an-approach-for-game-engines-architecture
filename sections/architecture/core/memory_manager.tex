\subsubsection{Memory Manager}
A game engine's memory manager is one of the most important features, not only algorithms but a bad memory management can cause high impact on the game performance\cite{GameEngineArchitecture}. Some common memory management implementations are using a Stack-based allocator, this way the engine can allocate a continuous memory segmentation, in C++ this can be achieved using the malloc native method\cite{GameEngineArchitecture, Malloc}. Others memory management techniques are the single frame memory or double-buffered frame memory and object pooling\cite{GameEngineArchitecture, MemoryAllocationPatternsUsedInGameDevelopment}.
