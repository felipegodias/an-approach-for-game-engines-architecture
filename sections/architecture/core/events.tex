\subsubsection{Events} \label{sec:events}
In order to prevent code coupling\footnote{"...the manner and degree of interdependence between software modules..."\cite{SystemsAndSoftwareEngineeringVocabulary}} a event queue\footnote{"A queue stores a series of notifications or requests in first-in, first-out order. Sending a notification enqueues the request and returns. The request processor then processes items from the queue at a later time. Requests can be handled directly or routed to interested parties. This decouples the sender from the receiver both statically and in time."\cite{GameProgrammingPatterns}} or event manager can be used to dispatch messages from one service to another, the service that dispatches the message doesn't know who gonna receive that message that is also valid for the receiver, the service doesn't know who sent the message. This pattern is also know as publish subscribe and can be used to make communication between services such an input manager sending an event when the user taps in some keyboard key to others services such as the game loop manager\cite{GameProgrammingPatterns, ZenjectSignals, GangOfFour} as shown in figure \ref{fig:pub-sub}.
