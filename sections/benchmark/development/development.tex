\subsection{Development}
The development process is also an important thing to measure, since the implementation of the engine took more than half a year to reach this stable state and an additional week to develop the game, it was entirely developed in the source code without any visual editor tool to help the development. On the other hand, Unity is already available in the market and has an awesome visual editor to build games. With the Unity built-in tools were possible to develop the same game in almost four hours. So since unity already holds a bunch of features to help the game development, they won this one.
