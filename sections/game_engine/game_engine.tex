\section{What is a Game Engine?}
A game engine can be defined as an API\footnote{"In this case, “API” refers to “Application Programming Interface”, which at the level of a class, is defined by the set of exposed methods (whether “exposed” means public, documented of callable)."\cite{MendezBaudryMonperrus} "Modern software development is highly reliant on reusable APIs..."\cite{Bierhoff}.}, library\footnote{"Libraries provide pre-defined common functions to programmers for modular programming."\cite{Simsek}.} or framework\footnote{"Frameworks are of key importance for developing large-scale object-oriented software systems. They promise higher productivity and shorter time-to-market through design and code reuse." "Frameworks typically serve to implement (larger-scale) components, and are implemented using (smaller-scale) classes."\cite{FrameworkDesign}.} that makes the game development process easier, meaning that the most used game features were already implemented in a game engine such as memory management, resource management, rendering, physics simulation and others, that way the game developers can focus only on building the game mechanics itself\cite{3DGameEngineArchitecture}.
