\subsubsection{Unity}
According to itch.io\footnote{"itch.io is an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on independent video games. It’s a platform that enables anyone to sell the content they've created."\cite{ItchIoAbout}.} today Unity is the most used game engine for free games development and independent companies in the market\cite{ItchIoEngines}. Had its release date back in 2005 by Unity Technologies, Unity enables game developers to create any kind of game for a variety of platforms like Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Nintendo Wii, iPhone/iPad, Xbox 360, Android, Windows Phone 8, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Mobile, Adobe Flash Player, Linux, Nintendo Wii U, Gaikai, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and others. Unity uses C\# as main scripting\footnote{"scripting was the kind of high-level programming that had always been envisioned, in the ascent from low-level assembly language programming to higher levels of abstraction:  it was concise, and it removed programmers from concerning themselves with many performance and memory management details;"\cite{Scripting}} language but in the past had support for Boo\footnote{"Boo is an object oriented, statically typed programming language for the Common Language Infrastructure, with a Python-inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility. Features such as type inference everywhere, duck typing on demand, pattern matching and syntactic macros are just a few of the special features Boo offers, in addition to the standard features a modern CLR developer expects (classes, structs, enums, generics, extension methods, async/await and so on.)"\cite{Boo}} and UnityScript\footnote{"UnityScript is a .NET-based dialect of JavaScript, so the syntax is similar to the popular web dialect of JavaScript. You will see it referred to as “UnityScript,” “JavaScript,” “Java Script,” and “Javascript” on the Unity web site and in the editor, but it is not same as JavaScript for web sites."\cite{UnityScript}}. Some games developed using Unity were: Days to Die, Angry Birds 2, Angry Birds Epic, Cities: Skylines, Cuphead, Deus Ex: The Fall, Escape from Tarkov, Fallout Shelter, Gris, Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, Hollow Knight,  Kerbal Space Program, Oxygen Not Included, Pokémon GO, ReCore, Rust, Sonic Dash, Sonic Forces, Super Mario Run, Yandere Simulator, Monument Valley 2\cite{UnityGames}.
