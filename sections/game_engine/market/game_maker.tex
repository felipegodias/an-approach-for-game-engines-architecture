GameMaker is a 2D game engine that was released with the objective to help the game development for developers that doesn't have prior experience in programming. GameMaker uses the DnD\footnote{"Drag and Drop (DnDâ„¢) is a visual scripting tool that can be used to create your games without actually typing any code."\cite{GameMakerDragNDrop}} as primary form of development as shown in figure \ref{fig:dnd}, but also has support for GML\footnote{"GameMaker: Studio has its own proprietary programming language called the GameMaker Language (abbreviated to GML)."\cite{GML}} as an alternative programming language\cite{TheGameMakerStandard}. Like the engines described in the sections above, the GameMaker can also make games for a bunch of platforms like Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux Ubuntu, Android, iPhone/iPad, tvOS, fireTV, Android TV, Microsoft UWP, HTML5, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One\cite{GameMaker}. Some games developed in the GameMaker were Hotline Miami, Gunpoint, Risk of Rain, Super Crate Box and Nuclear Throne\cite{TheGameMakerStandard}.
