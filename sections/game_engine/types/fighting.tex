\subsubsection{Fighting}
Fighting games generally focus on hand-to-hand combat, simulating real combats or even extrapolating the rules from the real world having crazy combos and effects. Some of the fighting games do not focus only on one vs one fights, that said, players can battle a lot of enemies at once, this kind of sub-genre is usually called beat 'em up\cite{FundamentalsOfGameDesign}. Game engines that focus on fighting games focus their technologies in fluid animations for the characters and physics collision precision\cite{GameEngineArchitecture}. Some famous fighting games are Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros, Mortal Kombat, Mother Russia Bleeds and Castle Crashers\cite{FightingGames,BeetEmUpGames}.
