\subsubsection{MMO}
Massively multiplayer online game or just MMO, can be any kind of game that support lots of players simultaneously in the same world. Generally MMOs are RPGs, but there's no rule that action games can't also be MMOs (e.g. Battle Royales). MMOs have the heavy lifting in the server side instead of the game engine, but a lots of optimizations can be made in the engine to avoid unnecessary requests to the server\cite{GameEngineArchitecture}. Some famous MMO games are: Ragnarok Online, Tibia, World of Warcraft, Player Unknown Battlegrounds and Fortnite\cite{MMOGames,BattleRoyaleGames}.
