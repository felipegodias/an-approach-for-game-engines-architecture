\subsubsection{FPS}
First-person shooters had a great breakthrough in history, the first FPS games were located inside of corridors in order to have a good performance but nowadays they conquered large open worlds with incredible graphics. They are listed as the hardest game kind to produce, that's why some of the best technological advances in the game industry come from this kind. This kind of game focuses mostly on an efficient way to render large 3D virtual worlds, responsive camera control and some times small-scale online multiplayer capabilities\cite{GameEngineArchitecture}. Some of these games are: DOOM, Destiny, Titanfall, Half-Life and Overwatch\cite{FPSGames}.
