\subsection{Types of Game Engines}
Just like games, each game engine may focus on a different gender. The main reason for it is the efficiency of the features that the engine makes available to use. But some functionalities are developed in the same way every time, like rendering systems that can be shared between a lot of game genres. Other systems that can be reused are the audio player, physics simulator and so on.
