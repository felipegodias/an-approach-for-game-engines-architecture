\IEEEPARstart{V}{ideo} game development is not an easy task, before the 90', the game's source code was created exclusively for a single game, that way, source code reuse was really hard and create games by consequence. In the middle 90' Doom was launched by id Software. With a well-structured architecture, separating the main reusable components as rendering, audio player, physics simulation and others from the game-specific ones, the importance of a game engine was evident\cite{GameEngineArchitecture}. This article covers which features a game engine must have and how to architect it, and also covers the implementation of the Pluto Engine using the techniques described below and analyzes if creating a new game engine nowadays is worth it.
